# 📚 Learning HTML from Scratch

> Personal HTML learning project - Created since 2020

## 📖 About This Project

This is an HTML learning project created by **Jabes Nelma** back in **2020** during high school. At that time, there was a **Web Design** subject at school, and that's where the learning of HTML started.

Besides learning at school, self-teaching from the internet was also done, especially from the **[Petani Kode](https://www.petanikode.com/tutorial/html/)** website. That's why all the files here use Indonesian 😄

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project is **Jabes Nelma's learning archive** from scratch about HTML. The files here are the results of practice when first learning to create websites.

Why just pushing it to GitHub now? Because GitHub was **just learned recently**! So this is kind of a learning portfolio from the past that finally uploaded here.

- **[Petani Kode - HTML Tutorial](https://www.petanikode.com/tutorial/html/)**
- Web Design subject in high school

**Jabes Nelma** is a **Junior Frontend Developer** who is learning and developing skills in web development.

## 📝 Notes

This project is **NOT** a professional or client project. This is purely a **personal learning project** created by **Jabes Nelma** to document the learning journey from the beginning.

So if there's code that's still simple or not neat, that's natural because this is indeed the result of learning from scratch! 😅
