# 📚 Learning HTML from Scratch

> Personal HTML learning project - Created since 2020

---

## 📖 About This Project

This is an HTML learning project I created back in **2020** when I was still in high school. At that time, we had a **Web Design** subject at school, and that's where I started learning HTML.

Besides learning at school, I also self-taught from the internet, especially from the **[Petani Kode](https://www.petanikode.com/tutorial/html/)** website. That's why all the files here use Indonesian, because that's where I learned from 😄

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project is my **learning archive** from scratch about HTML. The files here are the results of my practice when I first learned to create websites.

Why am I just pushing it to GitHub now? Because I **just learned GitHub** recently! So this is kind of my learning portfolio from the past that I finally uploaded here.

## 📝 Notes

This project is **NOT** a professional or client project. This is purely a **personal learning project** that I created to document my learning journey from the beginning.

So if there's code that's still simple or not neat, that's natural because this is indeed the result of learning from scratch! 😅
